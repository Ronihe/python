# what is iterator: an obj can be iterated upon, an obj which returns data, one element at a time when next() is called on it.
# iterable: an object which will return an iterator when iter() is called on
# When next() is called on an iterator, the iterator returns the next item. It keeps doing so until it raises a StopIteration error.

# Generators are iterators

# generator expression:
# You can also create generators from generator expressions
# Generator expressions look a lot like list comprehensions
# Generator expressions use () instead of []
