1. data redundacy:
   Often, within an organization, files and applications are created by different programmers from various departments over long periods. This can lead to data redundancy, a situation that occurs when the same data is present in many places (files).

2. data inconsistency:
   Data is said to be inconsistent if multiple copies of the same data do not match with each other, which wastes storage space and duplicates effort.

3. difficult data access:
   Another issue is that the user needs to know the exact location of the file in order to access data, which can be a very cumbersome and tedious process. Let’s say the user wants to know the hostel allotment number of a specific student from 10,000 unsorted students’ records, it will prove to be quite monotonous.

4. Security problems
   Using a file-based system may lead to unauthorized access of data. If a student gains access to the file that contains his marks, he can change it without authorization.

5. Difficult concurrent access:
   Concurrency is the ability of the database to allow multiple users access to the same information at the same time. Typically, in a file-based system, when an application opens a file, that file is locked. This means that no one else can access the file at that moment in time.
