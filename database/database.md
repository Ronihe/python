## what is database:

A database is a shared collection of related data. By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know.

## database properties:

- A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the mini-world or the universe of discourse (UoD). Changes to the mini-world are reflected in the database.

- A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be called a database. For example, a list of random names cannot be considered a database but if we also note down those peoplesâ€™ addresses and phone numbers, then the data will have some inherent meaning (i.e. it will be an address book).

- A database is designed, built, and populated for different purposes.It has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested.
