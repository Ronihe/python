# class Shape:  # Shape is a child class of ABC
#     def area(self):
#         pass

#     def perimeter(self):

# In the example above, you can see that an instance of Shape can be created even though an object from this class cannot stand on its own. Square class, which is the child class of Shape, actually implements the methods, area() and perimeter(), of the Shape class. Shape class should provide a blueprint for its child classes to implement methods in it. To prevent the user from making a Shape class object, we use abstract base classes.
